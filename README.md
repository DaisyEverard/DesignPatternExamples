## To run a java project
navigate to the root of the project
run `javac mainFile.java` to compile the project
run `java mainFile` to run the compiled project with the main file as the entry point

if you run into problems:
- make sure the interpreter is finding the correct root. You may need to add a .vscode folder with a config file


For the folder structure to be correct
- you can only have a main file in the root directory as in `1-STRATEGY`, everything else must be in packages unless everything is in the root like `2-OBSERVER-PUSH`
